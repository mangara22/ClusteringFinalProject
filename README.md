# ClusteringFinalProject
A final group project for a Data Science Fundamentals class. This uses a dataset from *Kaggle* and a type of **Machine Learning** technique called *Clustering* (which is unsupervised, or has no labels for its input data) for grouping data points together to find meaningful patterns.


## There were 4 different clustering models used by the group:
* K-Means
* BIRCH
* OPTICS
* Hierarchical
